    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to revolutionize customer support by deploying an intelligent agent capable of understanding context, managing multi-turn conversations, and providing accurate responses based on a knowledge base.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Context Awareness:</strong> Remembers previous interactions within the session.</li>
        <li><strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):</strong> Fetches relevant documentation to ground answers.</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation Protocol:</strong> Detects sentiment and complexity to hand off to human agents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <p>The solution is built using a modern AI stack:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> for the core backend logic.</li>
        <li><strong>LangChain</strong> for orchestrating LLM flows.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI GPT-4</strong> as the reasoning engine.</li>
        <li><strong>Pinecone</strong> for vector storage and retrieval.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>One of the main challenges was hallucination. We implemented a strict verification layer that cross-references the LLM's output with the retrieved context before sending the response to the user.</p>
